# spacex_project

## Project overview

Just a simple exercise  to consume the SpaceX API and notify users about upcoming rocket launches. As mentioned in the docs, V3 is deprecated so I used v4 for this project: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs/launches/v4

## Features
* List all upcoming launches - (https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/upcoming)
* View a specific launch - (https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/:id)
* Refresh the upcoming launches list
* View a live countdown to the launch time
* Ability to favourite a launch and view all favourited launches
